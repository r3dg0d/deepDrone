A tool that records drone footage from the famous game rainbow six siege and learns from the footage.

deepDrone is a program that will record footage of drones in the game rainbow six siege automatically, and record the routes its taking from a top-down perspective.

Uses object detection and AI to detect, and annotate paths and objects that the drone sees.

# üìñ TO-DO:

- Download siege gameplay
- Edit videos to only be drone footage with Davinci Resolve
- Start messing with openCV, tensorflow, and neural nets
- Try OpenAI Playground?
- Code an autonomous R6Bot for multiplayer, that self-learns how to play. R6-AI. (like here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smM-Wdk2RLQ)
- Partner with Nvidia to make it a tool with GeForce so you can use it when your afk.
- Test screen recording with python and opencv or other library.
- Change directory for saved footage
- Auto-record when droning
