# deepDrone
A tool that records drone footage from the famous game rainbow six siege and learns from the footage.

# Preface
deepDrone is a program that will record footage of drones in the game rainbow six siege automatically, and annotate certain routes from several positions (top-down, first person) in an attempt to learn common positions for defenders on certain maps.

Uses object detection and AI to detect, trigger events, and eventually be fully autonomous.

# UPDATE: R6 Has a replay system now, this project is useless and discontinued.
